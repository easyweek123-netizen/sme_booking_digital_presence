# BookEasy: Business Strategy & Motivation

> **Purpose:** This document outlines why we're building BookEasy, who we're building it for, and how we'll reach the market. For technical implementation details, see [AI_GTM_TECHNICAL.md](./AI_GTM_TECHNICAL.md).

---

## 1. Why This Niche?

### The Problem

Solo wellness and therapy practitioners (massage therapists, holistic healers, coaches) struggle with:

- Manual booking via phone/email/WhatsApp
- No-shows and last-minute cancellations
- Scattered client notes across notebooks and apps
- Time spent on admin instead of clients
- Existing tools are either too complex, too expensive, or take commissions

### Our Solution

BookEasy: An AI-powered booking assistant that lets practitioners manage their practice through natural conversation.

**Unique Value Proposition:**

> "Focus on your clients. Let AI handle the rest."

**Differentiator:** No other booking tool has an AI assistant. Practitioners can say "Show my schedule for tomorrow" or "Add a note for Maria" instead of clicking through menus.
